          Do you know what a fantasy draft is? Fantasy football, fantasy hockey, baseball, etc.? 
          Well, what if you could draft <em>anything</em>? Like, movies. Or better yet, 1990's action movies. 
          Or, celebrities. Or, beer commercials. Or, breakfast cereal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anything that can form a ranked list that people argue about, we can draft it. Just pick a collection, 
          invite your over-opinionated friends, and you show them what the best cereal is or ever was.
